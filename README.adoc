= Dev Center Documentation

This repository contains the Antora playbook and configuration for the **Dev Center** documentation site. It aggregates content from multiple sources to build a unified documentation portal.

== Project Structure

* `antora-playbook.online.yml`:: The production Antora playbook. Uses remote GitHub URLs for all content sources and the published UI bundle. Used by CI/CD.
* `antora-playbook.example.yml`:: A committed template for the local dev playbook. Copy this to `antora-playbook.yml` to get started.
* `antora-playbook.yml`:: Your local dev playbook (Git-ignored). Extends `antora-playbook.online.yml` but overrides content sources with local sibling directories.
* `antora-playbook.testing.example.yml`:: A committed template for full local testing. Copy this to `antora-playbook.testing.yml`.
* `antora-playbook.testing.yml`:: Full local testing playbook (Git-ignored). Extends `antora-playbook.yml` and additionally overrides the UI bundle with a local build.
* `docs.code-workspace`:: VS Code workspace file configured for multi-root editing across documentation sources.
* `package.json`:: Defines dependencies and build scripts.

== Usage

=== Installation

Install the required dependencies using pnpm:

[source,powershell]
----
pnpm install
----

=== Getting Started (Local Development)

Copy the example playbook to create your local config:

[source,powershell]
----
cp antora-playbook.example.yml antora-playbook.yml
----

Then build the site locally:

[source,powershell]
----
pnpm build
----

=== Testing Local Plugins / UI

To also use a local UI bundle (e.g., when developing themes):

[source,powershell]
----
cp antora-playbook.testing.example.yml antora-playbook.testing.yml
# Edit antora-playbook.testing.yml to point to your local UI bundle
pnpm build:testing
----

=== Production / CI Build

To build with remote sources (as CI does):

[source,powershell]
----
pnpm build:online
----

The output will be generated in the `build/site` directory (or as configured in the playbook).

== Development

This project is best managed using the included VS Code workspace:

1. Open `docs.code-workspace` in VS Code.
2. Ensure the recommended extensions are installed (AsciiDoc, YAML, etc.).
3. Use the integrated terminal for running builds.
