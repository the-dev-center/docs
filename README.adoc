= Dev Center Documentation

This repository contains the Antora playbook and configuration for the **Dev Center** documentation site. It aggregates content from multiple sources to build a unified documentation portal.

== Project Structure

* `antora-playbook.yml`:: The main Antora configuration file that defines content sources and UI settings.
* `docs.code-workspace`:: VS Code workspace file configured for multi-root editing across documentation sources.
* `package.json`:: Defines dependencies, primarily the `antora` engine.

== Prerequisites

* link:https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] (LTS recommended)
* link:https://pnpm.io/[pnpm]

== Usage

=== Installation

Install the required dependencies using pnpm:

[source,powershell]
----
pnpm install
----

=== Building the Site

To generate the documentation site locally:

[source,powershell]
----
pnpm antora antora-playbook.yml
----

The output will be generated in the `build/site` directory (or as configured in the playbook).

== Development

This project is best managed using the included VS Code workspace:

1. Open `docs.code-workspace` in VS Code.
2. Ensure the recommended extensions are installed (AsciiDoc, YAML, etc.).
3. Use the integrated terminal for running builds.
